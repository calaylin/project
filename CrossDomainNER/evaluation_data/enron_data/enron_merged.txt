<START:person> Joe <END>:

I just returned to town and picked up your message re Enron General
Counsel's son and SMU. I am going to <START:location> Washington <END> early in the morning,
returning Wednesday evening.

I would be delighted to send a letter of recommendation to SMU Law School.
As a member of the School's Board of Visitors, I have had some success with
admissions, and would be happy try to help here. If he will send me a copy
of his <START:location> college <END> summary, I will prepare a letter and send it this week.

Hopefully, it will help. As you know, SMU is a long-time client, and <START:person> Kay <END> and
I, as well as the Firm, are significant money contributors to the School.

Regards.

<START:person> Ray H. <END>

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under <START:person> Fred Lagrasta <END>.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the east  The producer focus in the west and <START:location>Texas<END> will remain unchanged reporting  to <START:person>Mark Whitt<END> and <START:person>Brian Redmond<END> respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
<START:person> Laura Luce <END> will move from her role in the <START:location> Central Region <END> to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the <START:location> Central <END> and <START:location> Eastern Regions <END>.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
<START:person> Frank Vickers <END> will continue his current role in the <START:location> Eastern Region <END> and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the <START:location> Central Region <END>. 
 

There will be no changes to the <START:location> West <END> and <START:location> Texas <END> Origination groups headed respectively by <START:person> Barry Tycholiz <END> and <START:person> Brian Redmond <END>. 

Please join us in congratulating <START:person> Fred <END> , <START:person> Laura <END> and <START:person> Frank <END> in their new roles.

<START:person> Louise <END> & <START:person> John <END>
