Hi <START:person> James <END> :

My name is <START:person> Pat Brandt <END> and I work for the Legal Research Center ("LRC") in
<START:location> Minneapolis <END>.  As you may know, we are the nation's leading provider of
outsourced legal research and writing services.  Recently, we have entered
into a strategic business alliance with Integrity Interactive Corporation
("IIC"), to offer industry-leading, online compliance training - training
that could help Enron save millions in the event of a DOJ prosecution.
LRC's role in this alliance is to provide the legal research content for the
compliance courses and assist in the marketing and selling of the IIC
product.

You can view our compliance modules at <START:location> work <END> or <START:location> home <END> , as long as you have
access to the internet and a personal access code.  
ignore the note below to <START:person> dan <END> --it does not to apply to you!  scan pretty far
down for answers.

 glad we got to see carlos this weekend.  have a good week
<START:person> karen <END>


that's how you smart people are, always questioning authority.  I didn't write the damn answers, so suck it up and just bask in the knowledge that your are probably right, as usual.


Thanks, but I think I have some problems with a couple of these.  For example:
#2.  Does a glacier not move backwards?  Are there not famous glaciers in <START:location> Alaska <END> ?  Is <START:location> Alaska <END> not in <START:location> North America <END> ?


 <START:person> Dan Kessler <END> 
Voter Consumer Research
281-893-1010

  (2) What famous <START:location> North American <END> landmark is constantly moving
  backward?
 
 <START:location> Niagara Falls <END>. The rim is worn down about 2 and a half feet each year
 because of the millions of gallons of water that rush over it every
 minute.

 Baseball.
 
  (5) What fruit has its seeds on the outside?
 
 The strawberry.
 
  (6) In many <START:location> liquor stores <END>, you can buy pear brandy, with a real pear
  inside the bottle. The pear is whole and ripe, and the bottle is
  genuine; it hasn't been cut in any way. How did the pear get inside
  the bottle?
 
In <START:location> Minnesota <END>. The team was originally known as the Minneapolis Lakers and kept the name when they moved west.


<START:person> Joe <END>:

I just returned to town and picked up your message re Enron General
Counsel's son and SMU. I am going to <START:location> Washington <END> early in the morning,
returning Wednesday evening.

I would be delighted to send a letter of recommendation to SMU Law School.
As a member of the School's Board of Visitors, I have had some success with
admissions, and would be happy try to help here. If he will send me a copy
of his <START:location> college <END> summary, I will prepare a letter and send it this week.

Hopefully, it will help. As you know, SMU is a long-time client, and <START:person> Kay <END> and
I, as well as the Firm, are significant money contributors to the School.

Regards.

<START:person> Ray H. <END>

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under <START:person> Fred Lagrasta <END> .  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the <START:location> Eastern U.S. <END>  The producer focus in the <START:location> Western U.S. <END> and <START:location> Texas <END> will remain unchanged reporting  to <START:person> Mark Whitt <END> and <START:person> Brian Redmond <END> respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
<START:person> Laura Luce <END> will move from her role in the <START:location> Central Region <END> to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the <START:location> Central <END> and <START:location> Eastern Regions <END>.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
<START:person> Frank Vickers <END> will continue his current role in the <START:location> Eastern Region <END> and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the <START:location> Central Region <END>. 
 

There will be no changes to the <START:location> West <END> and <START:location> Texas <END> Origination groups headed respectively by <START:person> Barry Tycholiz <END> and <START:person> Brian Redmond <END>. 

Please join us in congratulating <START:person> Fred <END> , <START:person> Laura <END> and <START:person> Frank <END> in their new roles.

<START:person> Louise <END> & <START:person> John <END>

you're one of three friends i have in <START:location> calgary <END> and i don't see you anymore.  
drinks at the <START:location> auburn saloon <END>?  golf this weekend?  

Doing something nice for <START:location> California <END> has never been a priority here in the <START:location> Columbia River Basin <END>, where high-voltage power lines lope across irrigated fields of alfalfa, potatoes and wheat. 

In the last year, much of their salvation has come from the <START:location> Columbia River <END> , whose monstrous dams are the largest hydroelectricity machines in <START:location> North America <END>. 

All along the river, from <START:location> Portland, Ore. <END> , to <START:location> British Columbia <END> , utility companies, aluminum makers and farmers have joined to help save <START:location> California <END> -- but at a staggering price. Charging whatever <START:location> California <END> 's dysfunctional power market will bear, people in this narrow stretch of the <START:location> Northwest <END> have created a kind of <START:location> Kuwait <END> along the <START:location> Columbia <END>. 

Grand Coulee Dam, the biggest dam in <START:location> North America <END> and by far the largest hydroelectric plant, was primarily designed as a water-delivery device for farmers. 

''Absent being successful in getting loads down, we could be looking at quadrupling of the power rates,'' said <START:person> Paul Norman <END> , head of power operations at <START:location> Bonneville <END>. 

I'm pushing to move to the <START:location> Houston <END> standard for web servers which is two 
clustered pizza boxes (DL360s). 

This email is in regards to the Halloween party at the <START:location> Continental Club <END>.

I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of <START:location> Nebraska <END>.

The UT band walks by on the way to the <START:location> Alamodome <END>. We're on the second
floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).

On the way back to <START:location> Austin <END> for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off.

We are in <START:location> South Austin <END>. I have been drinking warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour.

We arrive at the <START:location> Erwin Center <END>.

As you can see, it is more popular in <START:location> London <END>.

Why would this work here in the <START:location> States <END>? 

Please see the attached documents forwarded to us from <START:location> London <END>. 

Is this assumption correct or is there any way to trade <START:location> UK <END> gas, <START:location> UK <END> electricity, Brent and metals on EOL directly through ENA?

OTC transactions will be arranged by originators in the <START:location> New York <END> office and booked in the name of ENA, and then a transaction will be entered into between ENA and the relevant Enron affiliate (eg ECTRIC) to transfer the economic position to the relevant Enron affiliate.

It is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ENA is located in <START:location> Houston <END>.

The trades are then confirmed from the <START:location> Houston <END> office.

I spoke with <START:person> Jamie <END> this morning and explained our concerns (which master to use, given the merger is there a legal need for novation, since these are <START:location> NY <END> law documents would assignment be more appropriate, what collateral is involved to be transferred) and have since received a message from their lawyer in <START:location> New York <END>.

Were you able to reach <START:person> Mark Taylor <END> in <START:location> Houston <END> re:  Enron's novation?

Thanks for this.  I think it may have to be sent to <START:location> North America <END>.


''This is not nice money,'' said <START:person> Alice Parker <END>, a retired farmer who heads a group that promotes irrigation in the Columbia Basin. 

But the executive, <START:person> Charles J. Hosken <END>, added, ''We would be imprudent if we did not maximize this market for our customer owners.'' 

''We are just happy to be lucky that we have reservoirs and dams that were built by people of great foresight,'' said <START:person> Brian R. D. Smith <END>, chairman of BC Hydro. 

As <START:person> Paul Pitzer <END>, a Columbia Basin historian, has written, farmers here have always felt that ''no price is too high to pay for their water so long as someone else is paying the bill.'' 

''We have a wonderful energy fit,'' <START:person> Mr. Smith <END> said, referring to BC Hydro's power-trading relationship with California, if not to Californians themselves. ''We have oversupply in the summer when they have got high demand, and we have got undersupply in the winter when they have got stuff to give to us.''

Unless conservation increases or the drought eases, <START:person> Mr. Norman <END> warned that by late summer, the Northwest's era of cheap power could come to a sudden and painfully expensive end. 

I think that the three of us should talk about this... however, unless <START:person> Tim H <END> disagrees, we should probably wait until after he has completed the scheduled meeting(s) that he has with PDX & Houston IT regarding the current policy issues.

At the moment <START:person> Chris Wiebe <END> is officially administrating
our web/file server, but I don't think this is where his interests lie, so I've been relying on <START:person> Colin <END> for most day-to-day admin.

Basically, it's <START:person> Tim H. <END> , <START:person> Maria Van Houten <END>, and myself. 

In terms of hardware, I've been in touch with Houston through <START:person> Dan Dietrich <END> and spoke with a helpful individual who is responsible for web servers down there.

At this point, <START:person> Tim H. <END> and I have agreed on two immediate actions that will be taken.

this was <START:person> Tim Heizenrader's <END> take on the error he was having with the smtp server in portland.

<START:person> Jen Fraser <END> , Director of Origination in EGM - December 5 from 12 to 1 in 30C1

Let me/ <START:person> Bharat <END> know if we should bring ERMS into the picture.

Please RSVP to <START:person> Priya Jaisinghani <END> by email, no later than Tuesday, October 24, to confirm 
your attendance!  

<START:person> Brian <END>:  Transwestern Pipeline Company asks that it be included on list of parties to the Motion for Modification of the Procedural Schedule, with the 
following footnote:  Transwestern supports the portions of the settlement 
proposal pertaining to transmission rights, and the designation of primary 
and secondary rights described on Appendix A.  Transwestern does not oppose 
the other parts of the settlement.  

This is an e-mail from some guy named <START:person> J.D. Horne <END>, who, according to the messages that were attached to this, is not a 21 year-old frat boy, but
an attorney of indeterminate age. He sent it to his friend <START:person> Brian Brice <END> and
it got forwarded around the country.

I hope this is of some use, I have schedule a meeting for Thursday @10:00 t=
o go over it with <START:person> Joe King <END>  

In-house freight books as is the case with <START:person> Scott <END> and myself experienced much more activity in 2000 then what we have seen thus far in 2001.

The U.S. broker MJLF, particularly <START:person> Bob Flynn <END> , has been trying to get this off the ground now for over 5 years and even had an unsuccessful JV with Citibank. 

The last time we tried to get this going was last year when we had an analyst named <START:person> Sameer <END> in the group who was coordinating the launch with Louise Kitchen.

 Since London has been able to get it going under the direction of <START:person> Scott Moncrieff <END> we should also be able to offer it here.

I agree with <START:person> Susan <END> that for non-EOL trades concluded by our traders in <START:location> NYC <END> and <START:location> Houston <END> that the ENA ISDA should be used.   <START:person> Ms. Zivic <END> had called me yesterday asking similar questions and that is the answer I gave her (subject to approval by the tax people).

<START:person> Mark <END> - Here is more to help you with the UK gas, UK electricity, Brent and metals question I asked you yesterday by email.

FYI, attached is an e-mail from <START:person> Janine Juggins <END> who works in the Enron Europe Tax Dept. 

I will confirm that with <START:person> Janine <END> when I talk with her this afternoon.

I'm afraid I keep missing <START:person> Mark Taylor <END>.
