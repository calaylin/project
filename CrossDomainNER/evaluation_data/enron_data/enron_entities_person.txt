''This is not nice money,'' said <START:person> Alice Parker <END>, a retired farmer who heads a group that promotes irrigation in the Columbia Basin. 

But the executive, <START:person> Charles J. Hosken <END>, added, ''We would be imprudent if we did not maximize this market for our customer owners.'' 

''We are just happy to be lucky that we have reservoirs and dams that were built by people of great foresight,'' said <START:person> Brian R. D. Smith <END>, chairman of BC Hydro. 

As <START:person> Paul Pitzer <END>, a Columbia Basin historian, has written, farmers here have always felt that ''no price is too high to pay for their water so long as someone else is paying the bill.'' 

''We have a wonderful energy fit,'' <START:person> Mr. Smith <END> said, referring to BC Hydro's power-trading relationship with California, if not to Californians themselves. ''We have oversupply in the summer when they have got high demand, and we have got undersupply in the winter when they have got stuff to give to us.''

Unless conservation increases or the drought eases, <START:person> Mr. Norman <END> warned that by late summer, the Northwest's era of cheap power could come to a sudden and painfully expensive end. 

I think that the three of us should talk about this... however, unless <START:person> Tim H <END> disagrees, we should probably wait until after he has completed the scheduled meeting(s) that he has with PDX & Houston IT regarding the current policy issues.

At the moment <START:person> Chris Wiebe <END> is officially administrating
our web/file server, but I don't think this is where his interests lie, so I've been relying on <START:person> Colin <END> for most day-to-day admin.

Basically, it's <START:person> Tim H. <END>, <START:person> Maria Van Houten <END>, and myself. 

In terms of hardware, I've been in touch with Houston through <START:person> Dan Dietrich <END> and spoke with a helpful individual who is responsible for web servers down there.

At this point, <START:person> Tim H. <END> and I have agreed on two immediate actions that will be taken.

this was <START:person> Tim Heizenrader's <END> take on the error he was having with the smtp server in portland.

your attendance!  

<START:person> Brian <END>:  Transwestern Pipeline Company asks that it be included on list of parties to the Motion for Modification of the Procedural Schedule, with the 
following footnote:  Transwestern supports the portions of the settlement 
proposal pertaining to transmission rights, and the designation of primary 
and secondary rights described on Appendix A.  Transwestern does not oppose 
the other parts of the settlement.  

This is an e-mail from some guy named <START:person> J.D. Horne <END>, who, according to the messages that were attached to this, is not a 21 year-old frat boy, but
an attorney of indeterminate age. He sent it to his friend <START:person> Brian Brice <END> and
it got forwarded around the country.

I hope this is of some use, I have schedule a meeting for Thursday @10:00 t=
o go over it with <START:person> Joe King <END>

In-house freight books as is the case with <START:person> Scott <END> and myself experienced much more activity in 2000 then what we have seen thus far in 2001.

The U.S. broker MJLF, particularly <START:person> Bob Flynn <END>, has been trying to get this off the ground now for over 5 years and even had an unsuccessful JV with Citibank. 

The last time we tried to get this going was last year when we had an analyst named <START:person> Sameer <END> in the group who was coordinating the launch with Louise Kitchen.

 Since London has been able to get it going under the direction of <START:person> Scott Moncrieff <END> we should also be able to offer it here.

I agree with <START:person> Susan <END> that for non-EOL trades concluded by our traders in <START:location> NYC <END> and <START:location> Houston <END> that the ENA ISDA should be used.   <START:person> Ms. Zivic <END> had called me yesterday asking similar questions and that is the answer I gave her (subject to approval by the tax people).

<START:person> Mark <END> - Here is more to help you with the UK gas, UK electricity, Brent and metals question I asked you yesterday by email.

FYI, attached is an e-mail from <START:person> Janine Juggins <END> who works in the Enron Europe Tax Dept.

I'm afraid I keep missing <START:person> Mark Taylor <END>.
