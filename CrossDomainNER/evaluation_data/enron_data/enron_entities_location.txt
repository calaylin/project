Doing something nice for <START:location> California <END> has never been a priority here in the <START:location> Columbia River Basin <END>, where high-voltage power lines lope across irrigated fields of alfalfa, potatoes and wheat. 

In the last year, much of their salvation has come from the <START:location> Columbia River <END>, whose monstrous dams are the largest hydroelectricity machines in <START:location> North America <END>. 

All along the river, from <START:location> Portland, Ore. <END>, to <START:location> British Columbia <END>, utility companies, aluminum makers and farmers have joined to help save <START:location> California <END> -- but at a staggering price. Charging whatever <START:location> California <END>'s dysfunctional power market will bear, people in this narrow stretch of the <START:location> Northwest <END> have created a kind of <START:location> Kuwait <END> along the <START:location> Columbia <END>. 

Grand Coulee Dam, the biggest dam in <START:location> North America <END> and by far the largest hydroelectric plant, was primarily designed as a water-delivery device for farmers. 

''Absent being successful in getting loads down, we could be looking at quadrupling of the power rates,'' said <START:person> Paul Norman <END>, head of power operations at <START:location> Bonneville <END>.

On the way back to <START:location> Austin <END> for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off.

OTC transactions will be arranged by originators in the <START:location> New York <END> office and booked in the name of ENA, and then a transaction will be entered into between ENA and the relevant Enron affiliate (eg ECTRIC) to transfer the economic position to the relevant Enron affiliate.
