"When I think about December I get that sick feeling in my stomach. I want to know how much pain they are going to feel after. What is it going to be like for them?" said their mother,  <START:person>  Elysse Mata <END>  .

The girls were born via cesarean section at nearly eight months' gestation and will be separated at Texas Children's Hospital in  <START:location>  Houston <END>  by a team of surgeons in a long and arduous procedure.

"The intestines appear to be intermingled but there appears to be enough intestines for both children," said  <START:person>  Dr. Darrell Cass <END> , pediatric surgeon and co-director of Texas Children's Hospital Fetal Center. 

Surgeons at Texas Children's Hospital in 1992 successfully separated  <START:person> Tiesha <END>  and  <START:person>  Iesha Turner <END> , who were 1 year old and shared a sternum, liver, entwined intestines and fused organs.

The couple and their 5-year-old son relocated from Lubbock to  <START:location>  Houston <END> , where the girls were born on April 11.

 <START:person>  Elysse Mata <END>  spends at least seven hours at the hospital each day, leaving when it is time to pick her son up from school.  <START:person>  John Mata <END> , her husband, works full time and spends every weekend at the hospital with his daughters.

 <START:person>  Cass <END>  said he expects each child to be able to live independently and to have a good life. 

The U.S. military plans to land its secretive X-37B robotic space plane in  <START:location>  California <END>  on Tuesday, ending a classified 22-month mission, officials said.

 <START:person> Schott <END> said the homes are believed to have been inhabited during the so-called Basketmaker era, when Native American communities in the area were beginning to grow crops for food and establish settlements.

"Most of these sites you find are small," said  <START:person>  Schott <END> , who took part in the project. 

No human remains were found,  <START:person>  Schott <END>  said.

Protesters have numbered in the thousands at some events since Friday in the  <START:location>  St. Louis <END>  area in demonstrations aimed at drawing attention to what they say is police mistreatment of blacks.

Chanting "black lives matter" and other slogans, protesters joined in prayer at a local church before marching to the nearby police department, a target for many who have expressed outrage over the Aug. 9 killing of  <START:person>  Michael Brown <END>  , 18, by  <START:location>  Ferguson <END>   police officer  <START:person>  Darren Wilson <END>  .

A grand jury is considering charges against  <START:person>  Wilson <END>  , who has been placed on administrative leave. Protesters want  <START:person>  Wilson <END>  arrested immediately and have called for the appointment of a special prosecutor.

Arriving in ragtag border towns like  <START:location>  Reynosa <END>  ,  <START:location>  Mexico <END>  ���s migrant kidnapping capital where police in armored vehicles patrol the streets and daytime shootouts are commonplace, migrants are picked off buses by gangs who federal authorities say are in cahoots with local officials.

 <START:person>  Juan Marcos Guardado <END>  , a 27-year-old roofer, said he was betrayed by a fellow Honduran shortly after arriving by bus in  <START:location>  Reynosa <END>  .

A senior Mexican migration official in  <START:location>  Tamaulipas <END>   told Reuters Mexican gangs now earn at least $100 million a year from kidnapping migrants, and business leaders believe it is closer to $250 million, based on the numbers of migrants passing through  <START:location>  Tamaulipas <END>   and kidnapping cases they are aware of.

���They charge the same for a child as for an adult or a pregnant woman,��� he said, estimating that at any given time, there is a revolving pool of 5,000 kidnapped migrants across  <START:location>  Mexico <END>   based on cases he has seen.

On June 13, a group of men hauled the 21-year-old Honduran single mother off a bus outside  <START:location>  Reynosa <END>  . 

When her cousin told them he couldn���t pay,  <START:person>  Quinonez <END>   feared she would be killed.

 <START:person>  Quinonez <END>   was later rescued and has a one-year visa to stay in  <START:location>  Mexico <END>  , where she advocates for migrant rights.

 <START:person>  Azteca <END>   said the bank ���fully complies with anti-money laundering regulations and has implemented additional programs in specific areas such as  <START:location>  Tamaulipas <END>   where authorities have expressed concerns about illicit activities.���

 <START:person>  Greg Palmore <END>  , a spokesman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in  <START:location>  Houston <END>  , said ���drop houses��� in  <START:location>  Houston <END>   alone generate ���into the millions of dollars��� a year for criminals. 

A March raid in  <START:location>  Houston <END>   freed 115 Central Americans, who had been kept almost naked in a house after their shoes and clothes were confiscated to prevent them from escaping.

Most  <START:location>  U.S. <END>   drop houses are in  <START:location>  Houston <END>   and south   <START:location>  Texas <END>  , U.S. immigration officials say, noting that many of the kidnappers are former kidnapping victims, while others are U.S. citizens.

In  <START:location>  Mexico <END>  , federal police have rescued 71,415 kidnapped migrants since 2007, according to the National Citizen Observatory, a civil group which monitors justice and security in  <START:location>  Mexico <END>  .

Almost all of those were Central Americans, with 51 percent hailing from  <START:location>  Guatemala <END>  , about a quarter from  <START:location>  El Salvador <END>   and just under 20 percent from  <START:location>  Honduras <END>  .

During her 10-day incarceration,  <START:person>  Quinonez <END>   was held in two different houses in residential neighborhoods of  <START:location>  Reynosa <END>  .

 <START:person>  Quinonez <END>   barely ate during her ordeal and picked up an eye infection.

They would also brag about how they controlled the police in  <START:location>  Reynosa <END>  .

Unable to pay,  <START:person>  Quinonez <END>   sunk into a deep depression. 

When her jailers told her to call her relatives for money, she secretly called contacts at a shelter in southern   <START:location>   Mexico <END>   and described her location.

The police, she would later learn, had been sent from  <START:location>  Mexico City <END>   to avoid leaks.

 <START:person>  Dr. Thomas Frieden <END>  , director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said health authorities are still investigating how the nurse became infected while caring for  <START:person>  Thomas Eric Duncan <END>   in an isolation ward at the hospital.

 <START:person>  Duncan <END>   died last week and the nurse is the first person to contract the virus on  <START:location>  U.S. <END>   soil, taking concerns about containing its spread to new heights.

She is "clinically stable,"  <START:person>  Frieden <END>   said, and the CDC is monitoring others involved in  <START:person>  Duncan <END>  's care in case they show symptoms of the virus.

President  <START:person>  Barack Obama <END>   was due to meet with senior members of his administration later on Monday to discuss ways to ensure the country's healthcare system was prepared to care for people with the virus, the White House said.

It follows that of a nurse's aide in  <START:location>  Spain <END>   who helped treat a missionary from  <START:location>  Sierra Leone <END>  , who died of the virus.

Emergency crews in protective gear removed five passengers with flu-like symptoms from an airplane at  <START:location>  Boston <END>  's Logan Airport on Monday, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Port Authority said.

The Emirates flight 237 was from  <START:location>  Dubai <END>  , and none of the ill passengers had recently been to  <START:location>  West Africa <END>  , said spokesman   <START:person>  Matthew Brelis <END>  .

"Out of an abundance of caution, the people were wearing protective gear when they went on board the plane and removed the passengers,"  <START:person>  Brelis <END>   said. 

That has raised concerns in the  <START:location>  West <END>   because it is close to  <START:location>  Baghdad <END>   and demonstrates the group's reach; while operating successfully in  <START:location>  Anbar <END>  , it is also on the verge of taking the strategic town of  <START:location>  Kobani <END>   hundreds of miles away in northern  <START:location>  Syria <END>   on the border with  <START:location>  Turkey <END>  .

There was no claim of responsibility for the bombings, but Islamic State claimed a string of attacks in  <START:location>  Baghdad <END>   on Sunday that left 45 dead.

The war in  <START:location>  Anbar <END>   and its conquest of  <START:location>  Mosul <END>   have allowed Islamic State to hold territory from eastern  <START:location>  Syria  <END>  across Sunni parts of  <START:location>  Iraq <END>   with the goal of establishing a caliphate.

In  <START:location>  Syria <END>  , three Islamic State fighters blew themselves up on Monday in  <START:location>  Kobani <END>  , a monitoring group said, with the hardline militants making slight advances inside the besieged Kurdish town.

The militant group wants to seize the town to consolidate a dramatic sweep across northern  <START:location>  Iraq <END>   and  <START:location>  Syria <END>  .

Four strikes southwest of  <START:location>  Kobani <END>   hit Islamic State units and destroyed a machine gun firing position, while three strikes northeast of  <START:location>  Kobani <END>   struck a militant unit and damaged a staging location and several buildings. Another strike hit an Islamic State garrison northwest of  <START:location>  Raqqa <END>  , the military said.

GoPro Inc's shares fell as much as 16 percent on Monday after a French journalist suggested that Formula 1 legend  <START:person>  Michael Schumacher <END>  's injuries in a ski accident last year might have been caused by a wearable camera made by the company.

 <START:person>  Moncet <END>   was reported to have spoken to  <START:person>  Schumacher <END>  's son,  <START:person>  Mick <END>  , but the journalist denied this in a tweet later.

 <START:person>  Schumacher <END>  , a seven-time Formula 1 champion, suffered severe head injuries in a skiing accident in  <START:location>  Meribel  <END>  in the  <START:location>  French Alps <END>   on Dec. 29.  <START:person>  Schumacher <END>   emerged from a medically induced coma in June. He has been receiving treatment at home since September.

A key visit during the trip was to  <START:person>  Yang Xueshan <END>  , the deputy chief of China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), who gave his blessing for the deal.

In letters signed by  <START:person>  Sigmar Gabriel <END>   and  <START:person>  Emmanuel Macron <END>   and seen by Reuters, the two ministers note that the European recovery is lagging that of other advanced economies, raising the risk of a "lost decade" of weak growth, excessively low inflation, high debt and high unemployment.

The letters ask  <START:person>  Henrik Enderlein <END>  , head of the Jacques Delors Institut in  <START:location>  Berlin <END>   and a professor at the Hertie School of Governance, and  <START:person>  Jean Pisani-Ferry <END>  , a French government adviser and former head of the  <START:location>  Brussels <END>  -based Bruegel think tank, to compile a report by mid-November with concrete reform proposals.

 <START:person>  Modigliani <END>   used to light candles are the centerpieces of an eye-popping 500 million pounds  of art put on show at Sotheby's on Friday.

The stars, though, are the  <START:person>  Giacometti <END>   and the  <START:person>  Modigliani <END>  , which Shaw said exemplify the huge increase in value for sculpture in recent years, a trend which began in 2010 when a life-sized bronze "Walking Man" by Giacometti sold in  <START:location>  London <END>   for 65 million pounds, almost four times its pre-sale estimate.

He said  <START:person>  Giacometti <END>   was inspired by the Egyptian sculptures that he saw in the galleries of the Louvre in  <START:location>  Paris <END>  , and had made his goddess riding a chariot as "an image of hope and renewal".

 <START:person>  Gurlitt <END>  , who died in May aged 81, had secretly stored hundreds of works by the likes of  <START:person>  Chagall <END>   and  <START:person>  Picasso <END>   at his  <START:location>  Munich <END>   apartment and a house in nearby  <START:location>  Salzburg, Austria <END>  .

A spokeswoman for the museum said it was still in talks with  <START:location>  Germany <END>   and the German state of  <START:location>  Bavaria <END>  , and that "current speculation" about the collection was to a significant extent inaccurate.

 <START:location>  Venice <END>   is the setting for the second-last novel in the sequence, "Temporary Kings", and the city locale allowed for conference delegates -- a mixture of academics and enthusiasts -- to visit places in the book and touch on Powell's own experience at a cultural conference there, which he incorporated into the novel.

"It's extraordinary that  <START:person>  Powell <END>   went to a literary conference in  <START:location>  Venice <END>   and then wrote a novel about it and now we are at conference in the same place discussing it," said film-maker  <START:person>  Helen Fitzwilliam <END>  , one of the delegates.

 <START:person>  Powell <END> . But the attractions of  <START:location>  Venice <END>   were too strong to be denied and "that is probably why we are here too".

Former publisher  <START:person>  Dan Tokenhouse <END>  , a character who has come to  <START:location>  Venice  <END>   to pursue a career painting angry socialist-realist canvasses such as "Four Priests Rigging a Miracle", lives in a more obscure part of town.

 <START:person>  Franceschini <END>  , who is pressing for more public and private funds to sustain the floating city of  <START:location>  Venice <END>   and the fragile Uffizi gallery in  <START:location>  Florence <END>  , said accepting works of art as tax payments would allow the state to achieve a "double objective".

Among the goods, which included an archaeological site east of  <START:location>  Rome <END>   and four bronze sculptures, only one painting was finally bequeathed to the state.

Finnish writer  <START:person>  Sofi Oksanen <END>   arrives for an interview in a  <START:location>  Frankfurt <END>   hotel in trademark vivid make-up and theatrical outfit -- a black and violet suit topped with her customary black, blue and purple dreadlocks.

It took "big guys", cranes and a street closure to move four steel installations weighing more than 200 tons by American minimalist sculptor  <START:person>  Richard Serra <END>   into a  <START:location>  London <END>   gallery.

Another, "Backdoor Pipeline" (2010), is in some ways an offshoot of the walk-through snail-like structure that  <START:person> Serra <END>  , 74, made for the Guggenheim Museum in  <START:location>  Bilbao <END>  .

You might not want it to end up in  <START:location>  San Francisco <END>  .

Relatively unknown outside of  <START:location>  France <END>   and a media recluse,  <START:person>  Modiano <END>  's works have centered on memory, oblivion, identity and guilt. 

 <START:person>  Modiano <END>  , 69, was born in the  <START:location>  Paris <END>   suburb of  <START:location>  Boulogne-Billancourt <END>   in July 1945, several months after the official end of the Nazi occupation in late 1944.

His protagonist is  <START:person>  Dorrigo Evans <END>  , a doctor and a soldier in the Australian army who is taken prisoner on  <START:location>  Java <END>  , presumably in 1942.

The U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for same-sex matrimony to proceed in  <START:location>  Idaho <END>   on Friday by lifting a temporary hold imposed earlier in the week, capping a week of victories for supporters of gay marriage in  <START:location>  America <END>  .

In  <START:location>  Alaska <END>   a federal judge was due to hear oral arguments on Friday in a lawsuit brought by five same-sex couples who are challenging that state's marriage prohibition.
